# TwistySolver
A solution to solving the traditional rubiks cube puzzle
# Goals for the code
* write readable modifiable code that can be maintained
* write in such a fashion that the code may be applied to other sorts of twisty puzzles without too much effort 
# Technical Goals 
* I want this to not only give a solution but a near optimal solution, we know that 'Gods' number is 20, but I would be happy if this project can get it to 30
